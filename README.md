# Pizza-Sales
Hello everyone, I hope all is well with you!

Wonderful news! I'm thrilled to introduce my newest project, the Pizza Sales Dashboard, which was painstakingly crafted using the amazing Excel tool.

This dashboard is a treasure trove of information about our store's pizza sales performance, highlighting important indicators such as Total Revenue, Overall Orders, Total Pizzas Sold, Average Order Value, and Average Pizzas per Order. To enhance visualization, I've utilized multiple charts, including:

Column Chart: Daily Trend for Total Orders
Line Chart: Hourly Trend for Total Orders
Donut Chart: Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
Pie Chart: Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
Additionally, I created visualizations for the Top and Bottom 5 Sellers and set an Order Date Slicer for visualization by year.

The process started with gathering data from the reliable GitHub website. From there, I rolled up my sleeves and got to work, meticulously cleaning the dataset, creating critical data details, and performing operations that make a real impact.There is description box also, that is the highlighter of the dashboard.

The result is an attractive, informative dashboard featuring well-considered charts .
